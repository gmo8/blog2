### Art Piece 1

My first piece is called Carbon Space by Chris Cheung. Before I read the description, I watched the video and it reminds me that today, carbon has a negative feeling towards it. However, carbon is the building block to every organic being. I began thinking that if it is chance operation, it would be very symbolic to the process of evolution via carbon based organisms, which is an incredible representation if that was in fact the idea behind it. It is also something that I would love to experiment with. Then, I read the description and it is in fact a visual representation of atmospheric CO2. Because this piece chances based on data, it is not random, however I really enjoyed my thought process during my discovery of the piece. It turned from an uplifting piece to a piece that brought me right back to reality.

### Art Piece 2

The other piece I chose was a chance operation piece by Manfred Mohr that randomly chose to draw lines between the eleven and fifteen dimensions. I originally chose that piece because I was very confused by how it chose between fifteen dimensions. That idea just did not make sense to me (and still doesnâ€™t) however the art piece came out beautifully. I got lost staring at the piece trying to understand how it was created. From the description, it sounds like the piece moves, but unfortunately there is no video.
